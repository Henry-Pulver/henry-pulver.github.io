                <h4>The Need for Scalable Assessment</h4>
            </header>
                <p> Attitudes towards online education are shifting - more people than
                    ever are going online for their education. Methods for scalable
                    online assessment, however, have not kept up with the pace.</p>

                <p>The scalable assessment methods prevalent in massive
                    open online courses (MOOCs) are fundamentally flawed.
                    MOOCs most commonly use algorithmic assessment which severely
                    limits the types of questions that can be asked. Also, cheating
                    is trivial. This brings into question the respect held for
                    qualifications assessed algorithmically.
                </p>

                <p>Next most popular is peer-assessment. Here questions can be
                    chosen slightly more flexibly, but the quality
                    of the assessment and feedback is limited. For these reasons,
                    both peer and automated assessment are inadequate for reputable
                    accreditation or grading. MOOC course
                    directors report that this is a key obstacle for MOOCs.</p>

                <p>In contrast, human assessment allows course directors to flexibly
                    create challenging, thought-provoking questions. Conceptual
                    questions that require argumentation, diagrams, design
                    and creativity usually reinforce students’ learning the most.
                    Human assessment also enables personalised and informative
                    feedback.</p>

                <p>Thanks to the ease of online distribution,
                    expositional content - lectures, videos, notes, etc. - scales
                    well to arbitrarily large cohorts. In contrast, human assessment
                    and feedback from subject experts currently doesn’t as the
                    assessor pool is typically limited to the course director’s
                    students and colleagues.
                </p>

                <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            </header>
                <p>We believe that an online gig-economy marketplace could facilitate
                    scalable human assessment whilst benefitting assessors. This
                    would connect freelance, subject-specialist assessors with course
                    directors through an online platform.</p>

                <p>As well as earning generous wages, being an assessor has many
                    opportunities for personal and professional growth. Assessing
                    work and giving feedback is a powerful way of developing subject
                    mastery <a
                            href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/02602938.2018.1484881">[1]</a>.
                    It’s also a fantastic opportunity to build and demonstrate
                    teaching experience. Our assessors do all this while
                    working flexibly - from wherever they like and on their schedule!
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center"><b>Anyone with a degree, or who is currently in higher
                    education, can
                    register as an assessor. </b></p>

                <p>To ensure assessments can be trusted, we developed a robust
                    statistical model to calibrate the marks, flag unreliable assessors,
                    and adjust assessor rates. This will require double-marking some
                    student scripts so assessors’ relative consistency and bias can be
                    inferred and controlled for. This also allows us to recognise and
                    reward the most exceptional assessors.</p>
