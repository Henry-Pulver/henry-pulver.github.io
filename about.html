                <h4>The Need for Scalable Assessment</h4>
            </header>
                <p> Attitudes towards online education are shifting - more people
                    than ever are going online for their education. Thanks to the
                    ease of online distribution, expositional content - lectures,
                    videos, notes, etc. - scales well, so there is no limit on the
                    number of students. However, methods for quality scalable online
                    assessment have not kept up with the pace. </p>

                <p>The scalable assessment methods prevalent in massive
                    open online courses (MOOCs) are fundamentally flawed.
                    MOOCs most commonly use algorithmic assessment which reduces the
                    depth of understanding that can be explored. Also, it makes
                    cheating child’s play, which devalues the qualifications received.
                </p>

                <p>Next most popular is peer-assessment. This decreases the
                    quality of feedback and the reliability of the assessment as
                    assessors aren’t subject experts. For these reasons,
                    both peer and automated assessment are inadequate for reputable
                    accreditation or grading. MOOC course
                    directors report that this is a key obstacle for MOOCs.</p>

                <p>In contrast, human assessment allows course directors to
                    create challenging, thought-provoking questions. Conceptual
                    questions that require argumentation, creativity and design
                    usually reinforce students’ learning the most. Human assessment
                    also enables personalised and informative feedback. However, the
                    number of students who can access this is limited as assessors
                    are restricted to the course director’s students and colleagues.</p>

            <header class="medium">
                <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            </header>
                <p>Our solution is an online gig-economy marketplace that will
                    facilitate scalable human assessment whilst benefiting assessors.
                    This would connect freelance, subject-specialist assessors with
                    course directors through an online platform.</p>

                <p>As well as earning generous rates, being an assessor provides
                    opportunities for personal and professional growth. Assessing
                    work and giving feedback is a powerful way of developing subject
                    mastery <a
                            href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/02602938.2018.1484881">[1]</a>.
                    It’s also a fantastic opportunity to build and demonstrate
                    teaching experience. Our assessors do all this while
                    working flexibly - from wherever they like and on their schedule!
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center"><b>Anyone with a degree, or who is currently in higher
                    education, can
                    register as an assessor. </b></p>

                <p>To ensure assessments can be trusted, we developed a robust
                    statistical model to calibrate the marks, flag unreliable assessors,
                    and adjust assessor rates. By double-marking some
                    student scripts, assessors’ relative consistency and bias can be
                    inferred and controlled for. This also allows the most
                    exceptional assessors to recognised and rewarded.</p>
