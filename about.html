                <h4>The Need for Scalable Assessment</h4>
            </header>
                <p> Attitudes towards online education are shifting - more people than
                    ever are going online for their education. Methods for scalable
                    online assessment, however, have not kept up with the pace.</p>

                <p>Lecture material scales well to large cohorts as it is easily
                    distributed online. In contrast, expert human assessment is
                    handicapped by scalability as the assessor pool is typically limited
                    to a small group of colleagues and students of the course director.
                </p>

                <p>Human assessment allows course directors to flexibly create
                    challenging, thought-provoking questions. Thought-provoking,
                    conceptual questions, such as essays or mathematical proofs, which
                    are difficult to assess algorithmically, usually reinforce students’
                    learning the most. Human assessment of these more open questions
                    also allows for personalised and informative feedback.</p>

                <p>The scalable assessment methods (multiple-choice/peer assessment)
                    currently used in massive open online courses (MOOCs) don’t promote
                    deep thought and learning. They also limit the quality of feedback
                    and prevent reputable accreditation. MOOC course directors report
                    that this is a key obstacle for existing MOOCs.</p>

            <header class="medium">
                <h4>Our Solution</h4>
            </header>
                <p>We believe that an online gig-economy marketplace could facilitate
                    scalable human assessment. This would connect freelance, subject
                    specialist assessors with course directors through an online
                    platform.</p>

                <p>To ensure assessments can be trusted, we developed a robust
                    statistical model to calibrate the marks, flag unreliable assessors,
                    and adjust assessor rates. This will require double-marking some
                    student scripts so assessors’ relative consistency and bias can be
                    inferred and controlled for.</p>

                <p>We believe that the platform should also allow assessors to build
                    professional reputation. A platform on which being a well-performing
                    assessor yields professional respect akin to being a moderator on
                    Wikipedia, or an active contributor to StackOverflow would
                    incentivise quality assessors to join and contribute to the
                    platform.</p>
